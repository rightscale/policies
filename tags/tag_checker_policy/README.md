### EC2 Tag Checker Policy

**What it does**

Uses RightScale Cloud Language (RCL) to check all instances in an account for a given tag key and reports back which
servers or instances are missing the tag.

**Scheduling when the policy runs**

To control the frequency that the policy CAT runs, you should [create a schedule and associate it with the CAT](http://docs.rightscale.com/ss/guides/ss_creating_schedules.html) in RightScale Self-Service.

Specify the days of the week that you want the CAT to run. For example, if you want the policy CAT to run once a week on Monday, specify a schedule of only Monday. For the hours you should specify approximately a 30 minute time window for the policy CAT to complete. (It should take less than 15 minutes to run).

**Cost**

This policy CAT does not launch any instances, and so does not incur any cloud costs.
